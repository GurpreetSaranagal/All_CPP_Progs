A variable is a container to hold data
Variable can be of various types. Primarily we have these variable types in C++
    1. int 
    2. float
    3. char
    4. double
    5. boolean -> {1,0}

int sum = 34;
means sum is an integer variable which holds value 34 in memory

SYNTAX FOR DECLARING VARIABLE
Data_type variable_name = Value;
Based on scope , variable can be classified into two types
    1. Local Variables
    2. Global Variables
-------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLE SCOPE
Scope of a variable is the region in code where the existence of variable is valid.
Based on scope we have Local and Global variables in C++

LOCAL VARIABLES :
local variables are declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only from there

GLOBAL VARIABLES :
Global variables are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere.

Can global and local variable have same name in c++?
    YES
-------------------------------------------------------
C++ DATA TYPES 
Data types define the type of data a variable can hold, for example an integer variable can hold integer data, a character type variable can hold character data etc.

Data types in c++ are categorised in three groups:
    Built - in 
        int -> 1,2,3,4,5 etc whole numbers 
        float -> decimal numbers
        char -> 'd', 'f' etc 
        double -> high precision decimal numbers
        bool -> true, false
    User defined 
        struct 
        union 
        enum
    Derived 
        array
        function 
        pointers
--------------------------------------------------------
RULES TO DECLARE VARIABLES
Variable names in c++ can range from 1 to 255 charcters.

all variable names must begin with a letter of alphbet or an underscore(_).

After the first initial letter, variable names now can also contain letters and numbers.

Variable names are case sensitive.
 
No spaces or special characters are allowed.

You cannot use a C++ keyword (a reseeved word) as a variable name.
